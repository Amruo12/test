    "## Part 5: Implementing Input Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "Our game would be pretty boring if there was no way to control the character. To complete this we need to implement input handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can accomplish this by implementing a new class called InputHanlder. This class should have four boolean properties, one for each of the four directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will need to watch for 4 keys being pressed, up, down, right or left, and the same four keys being released. When the keys are down we need to set the corresponding boolean in the input handler, and when the keys are released we need to clear that boolean value. Finally, we need to check in the Player's \"move\" function if any of those booleans are set, and if they are we need to apply a change in velocity to the player class. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through these elements one by one. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can detect keys being pressed and released using the keyboard functions. A brief code snippet explaining this is shown here:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "...\n",
    "from kivy.core.window import Window\n",
    "...\n",
    "<in init function>\n",
    "self._keyboard = Window.request_keyboard(self._keyboard_closed, self)\n",
    "self._keyboard.bind(on_key_down=self._on_keyboard_down)\n",
    "self._keyboard.bind(on_key_up=self._on_keyboard_up)\n",
    "...\n",
    "<in class>\n",
    "def _keyboard_closed(self):\n",
    "    self._keyboard.unbind(on_key_down=self._on_keyboard_down)\n",
    "    self._keyboard = None\n",
    "\n",
    "def _on_keyboard_down(self, keyboard, keycode, text, modifiers):\n",
    "    if keycode[1] == 'up':\n",
    "        # your code for handling \"up\" press here...\n",
    "    if keycode[1] == 'down':\n",
    "        # your code for handling \"down\" press here...\n",
    "    \n",
    "def _on_keyboard_up(self, keyboard, keycode):\n",
    "    if keycode[1] == 'up':\n",
    "        # your code here for handling \"up\" release here...\n",
    "```\n",
    "You should implement this code inside the InputHandler.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have our keys presses correctly implemented, we now need to add a velocity to the player. We can do this by increasing or decreasing the x or y velocity if the key is down by a constant amount of 0.1. Since we have already implenting clamping in the previous section, we do not need to worry about adding it here. Add this functionality here.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you complete this, then you will have input handling working."

    "\n",
    "The final step of this lab is to implement collision detection and resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "First add an enemy to the game with the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "x     = 200\n",
    "y     = 200\n",
    "r     = 30\n",

    "color = [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should implement this directly in the python code rather than the Kivy file as we will need to add additional enemies at a later time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next we need to create a collision function for the player and the enemy. \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of a collision function is to determine if two objects are overlapping. This is found via the following  formula derived from the geometry of the objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 < (r_2 + r_1)^2 $\n",
    "\n",
    "If this inequality holds, then a collision is occuring. In the event that a collision is detected, we need to handle this in some way. This is known as collision resolution. Typically in this process we want to ensure the overlap is corrected, and that velocities change in some meaningful way to indicate deflection. The simplest way to handle this is to exchange velocities between the two objects, which simulates a mass-ignoring momentum transfer. To accomplish this, simply swap the v_x and v_y variables of the two objects with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Too accomplish this, create a new function in Cell called collisionResolution which takes a pair of Cells and checks for and resolves a collision. Call this function with the Player and the Enemy in the update function, after move.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some limitations to this simplistic resolution process, but we can correct these in Phase 2. "
